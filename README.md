Frogger Game
Frogger is a classic arcade game where the player controls a frog trying to cross a busy road and a river full of hazards. This project is an implementation of the Frogger game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play
Starting the Game: Click the "Start/Pause" button to begin the game. You control a frog represented by a green square.

Moving the Frog: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the frog. Your goal is to reach the "ending-block" area at the top of the screen.

Avoiding Obstacles: Dodge cars and logs while crossing the road and river. Falling into the water or getting hit by a car will result in losing the game.

Winning: Successfully reach the "ending-block" area to win the game. You'll see a "You Win!" message.

Losing: If you run out of time, collide with obstacles, or fail to reach the end, you'll lose the game. A "You Lose" message will be displayed.

Game Rules
You have a limited amount of time (displayed as "Time Left") to complete the game. Time decreases as you play.

Avoid colliding with moving cars (car-left and car-right) and sinking in the river.

Jump onto logs (log-left and log-right) to cross the river safely.

The game ends when you either win or lose. You can start a new game by clicking the "Start/Pause" button again.


Certainly, here's a simple README.md file for your Frogger game:
